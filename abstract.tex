In the last decades, our capability for gathering and storing large amounts of data has increased a lot. Once we want to analyze and understand this information, it might be difficult due to its size. In some cases, it could be interesting to reduce the dimension, that is, discard the information that is not highly relevant to keep only the pieces of information which are meaningful. The way we proceed with this selection is one of objectives of Multivariant Statistics.

Multivariate Statistics is the branch of Statistics which handles multivariate data, that with dimension greater than one. We store multivariate observations in the data matrix. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a technique from Matrix Algebra which can help to summarize end compress the information in the data matrix.

One straightforward advantage of SVD application is to facilitate the analysis of sample information. The objective of this project is to study how SVD is used in several multivariate techniques: principal components analysis, canonical correlation analysis and aproximation and completrion of matrices.

The theory and the procedures studied and proved are later tested with real data using R. The adequate application of these tools shows the power and utility of SVD in current data of a great variety of topics.
